# TOR-W:L Website

This is the official website for the TOR-W:L mod. This contains everything about the mod, such as a features page containing the features, a roles page, a configarable settings page for presets and more!

## Website Plans

I plan to do more to the website, but since it takes time to make the roles, fins role icon designs, buttons and so on, it is a bit challanging.
I only have 2 people on the development team, consisting of me and a friend of mine. It does take time, as I said, which I don't have right now since I'm finishing school this year. So I'm shifting my focus to school work and a lot less to coding as of right now, which gives a delay in development.
But I plan to add the new roles, role icons, role screenshots and gameplay of the roles.
