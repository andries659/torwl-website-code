It added the new roles from v2.1-r, a new features page which shows all the features the mod adds.\nThis will most likely update a week or two later than which v3.0-r fully releases.\n\nSome of the stuff will be added to the website from the test version of 3.0, so it is a lot less when the full version releases in March.\n\nThanks for your support, it helps me to continue even when some stuff are making it harder to continue."
